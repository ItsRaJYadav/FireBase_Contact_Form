# FireBase_Contact_Form

A contact form for your site that sends you an email notification when someone hits that “Submit” button.
You get an email in your inbox saying something like, “Hey hey, so-and-so just sent you a message saying this and that.
Hurry up and reply.” You’ll get to see their name, email, and message in your inbox.
